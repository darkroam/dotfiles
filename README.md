# dotfiles
my dotfiles for linux

startx -- .xinitrc
             \------.profile

xorg -- .xprofile



[2020-02-29] I try to restart my dotfile config.
[2020-03-08] .config/mpd/mpd.conf does not modify.
	     I did not config the [sxiv vifm wget] app.

## Install

Install config tracking in your $HOME by runinng:

	curl -Lks https://github.com/darkroam/dotfiles/raw/master/.local/bin/install.sh | /bin/bash
